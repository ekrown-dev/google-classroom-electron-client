## Secure Architecture Overview

```
Claude Desktop ‚Üí Electron Bridge (localhost:5123) ‚Üí MCP Server (mcp.ekrown.com/api) ‚Üí Google Classroom APIs
                      ‚Üì
              License Verification & Trial Management
                      ‚Üì
              Supabase Authentication & Stripe Billing
